    "discussion": "After hundreds of hours of discussions with various companies in the energy industry, we kept coming back to problems for distribution network operators that also influence other companies while working on the energy transition.",
    "problem": "To understand the problem further, we spoke to distribution network operators around Europe. The increasing number of decentralized energy producers and consumers will force companies to monitor and regulate low-voltage networks in real time in the future. To do this, a very large amount of data, which comes from various measuring devices in the network, existing software and external sources such as weather forecasts, must be processed almost in real time.",
